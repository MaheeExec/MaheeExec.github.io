            Throughout my school days, I have demonstrated strong leadership
            skills through various roles, including team management, project
            leadership, and strategic planning. My leadership experience has
            been marked by successful project outcomes, team development, and
            strategic improvements. Imagine being the captain of a ship, but
            your ship is a kitchen, and your crew is a team of six enthusiastic
            chefs. The challenge? A national &aposCooking Without Fire&apos
            competition. With a sprinkle of guidance, a dash of motivation, and
            a generous helping of teamwork, we navigated through the choppy
            waters of culinary challenges. Leading this team wasn&apost just
            about winning, it was about blending our skills to create something
            deliciously extraordinary. That&aposs the essence of leadership!

            Photography allows me to capture moments and explore the world
            through a creative lens, finding beauty in everyday life. It&aposs a
            way to express myself artistically while preserving memories that
            tell a story.

            Drawing lets me bring my imagination to life, turning ideas into
            visual art that reflects my thoughts and emotions. Itâ€™s a relaxing
            and fulfilling way to explore creativity and improve my artistic
            skills.
